- 🐱 **Cat obsession** - because every good witch needs her familiars
- 🐕 **Dog love** - loyal companions make the best sidekicks
- 💰 **Financial wisdom** - turning financial education into something magical

What started as a playful experiment in collaborative coding with AI became a charming tribute to the person who makes every day feel like a magical adventure!
